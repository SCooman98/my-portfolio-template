### The Challenge
Enterprise financial tools are often cluttered, difficult to use, and lack visual hierarchy. The goal of this project was to create a dashboard that simplifies complex financial data while maintaining robust functionality for power users.

### The Solution
We adopted a modular widget-based architecture that allows users to customize their view. 
- **Dark Mode First**: To reduce eye strain for analysts working long hours.
- **Data Visualization**: Custom D3.js charts that update in real-time.
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### Key Features
1. Real-time stock tracking
2. Automated report generation
3. Multi-currency support
4. Role-based access control
